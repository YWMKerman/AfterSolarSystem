# _****Introduction****_
_After Solar System, also called Future Solar System, aims to simulate the scenario of the solar system 7.9 billion years later according to the prediction which is made in the current situation of our solar system:_ 

_The sun will stay in the current stage for about 10 billion years before leaving the main sequence stage. Then it will expand into a red giant, devouring the objects surrounding it, including Mercury and Venus, and entering helium flash phase which might cause ice disappearing on the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The orbits of all surviving celestial bodies will move outward, and the heat from the sun will make the temperature of Uranus rise to tens of degrees Celsius above zero. During the process, the mass of the sun will slowly decrease due to the substance ejections. Meanwhile, life can only survive in the proper level of light and heat, where it is very far away from the sun._

_In this mod, the time is set to when the sun in in its initial AGB (Asymptotic Giant Branch) phase. During the phase, the sun becomes more and more unstable, and may erupt again at any time according the prediction. It will destroy all the surviving celestial bodies during successive eruptions and turn the solar system into ruins. Finally, the sun will end its AGB phase that lasted only 800 thousand years and become a white dwarf, making the solar system a dead silence._

### _***AfterSolarSystem is compatible with (or provides support for) the following mods:***_
- [Environmental Visual Enhancements](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases)
- [Scatterer](https://spacedock.info/mod/141/Scatterer)
- [Distant Object Enhancement](https://spacedock.info/mod/2274/Distant%20Object%20Enhancement%20Continued)
- [Sigma Replacements: Skybox](https://github.com/Sigma88/Sigma-Replacements/releases)
- [TUFX](https://github.com/shadowmage45/TUFX/releases)

### _***AfterSolarSystem is not compatible with the following mods:***_
- External visual mods (RVE, RSSVE, EVO, etc.)
- External planet mods (RealSolarSystem, AfterKerbin, BeyondHome, etc.)

### _***Recommended mods to install:***_
- [KSPIE](https://spacedock.info/mod/172/KSP%20Interstellar%20Extended)
- [Better Time Warp](https://spacedock.info/mod/1162/BetterTimeWarpContinued)
*** 
_"After Solar System Mod" theoretically does not have very high performance requirements (in the case of only using Scatterer as a visual module), I can run relatively smoothly on a 2015 notebook of my grandmother, and the configuration of this notebook is I3-5005U 10GB DDR3 memory and Intel's core graphics card, 1TB mechanical hard disk. This may be the minimum requirement to ensure the visual situation as much as possible_
***Therefore my recommendation is:***
- Your processor needs to have at least 4 cores and 8 threads.
- RAM at least equal to or greater than 10GB
- It is best to use a graphics card with 2G or higher video memory
