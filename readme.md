# ***Introduction***

  `AfterSolarSystem` (`ASS` for short) This is a KSP plugin that allows you to witness the last glorious moment of the sun in a parallel montage method, and also a fan work of `RealSolarSystem` and `BeforeSolarSystem`.

  In the timeline of `AfterSolarSystem`, the sun has just left the Subgiant stage and enters the red giant stage, At this time, Jupiter has entered the habitable zone. There are four Galilean moons around Jupiter, three of which are covered with thick ice. But now the sun has changed everything here.  But unfortunately, Europa's mass is too small, and it cannot firmly absorb those gases. Therefore, Europa's atmosphere quickly became extremely thin due to the solar wind, and it became a hot and a wet world; and a little further Ganymede, because the evaporation of ice and liquid water has also made its atmosphere thicker, Ganymede has therefore formed a small greenhouse world; and the farther away Callisto, everything seems to be just right, with Pleasant temperatures, and liquid water Oceans, Lake...    
However, The journey does not stop at the Galilean satellites. Farther away from the solar system, Titan, once known as the most Earth-like Moon in the solar system, is also undergoing earth-shaking changes under the influence of the sun. As the temperature rises, the evaporation of methane and the intensification of weather activities gradually sow the seeds of life there...

Although you feel that you have traveled far, the influence of the sun goes far beyond this. In the more distant borders of the solar system, where the sun cannot shine, beyond the orbit of Neptune, there are many TNOs (Trans-Neptunian Objects). For a long time, there have been many solid gases on the surface of those TNOs, and now they are slowly sublimating into the atmosphere, which seems to add a touch of vitality to the distant and dark world...

The four rocky planets in the On the other hand solar system are now heading towards hell. The Earth, once our home, has become a scorching hot world as its oceans boil and evaporate under the influence of the sun and its atmosphere disappears. As for Mars, which is a little further away, although the last humans still reside here at this moment, the environment on Mars gradually becomes harsh: the oceans begin to approach the boiling point and the temperature soars. It won't be long before it will become hell.All humans residing on Mars will be forced to leave Mars and go to Titan. However, going to Titan is not the best option, because there are only less than 100 million years of worlds left for us there, so leaving the solar system is the best option.

***Let's take action.***

## ***Advantages Compared to RealSolorSystem***

ASS will restore the solar system in the early red giant stage as much as possible, and introduce a few sci-fi ideas such as transforming Mars to make it our home, as well as the vegetation on the surface of Titan, the moon, and the remaining relics on the surface of the earth...     If you consider that Neptune would probably be pretty lonely (because of the fall, only a few outer moons remain) you could even dive into Neptune's core and explore that windswept world.



ASS ensures the minimum occupation of system resources by allocating resources as reasonably as possible, while showing the most powerful visual effects to the greatest extent possible so as to reach at least the level of RealSolarSystem+RVE，So, how does it optimize your system resource usage?

1. The texture resolution is customized for each celestial body depending on the specific characteristics of the planet.
2. The features on the planetary surface are compressed to the maximum extent without affecting the visual effect.
3. Most unnecessary collision boxes are turned off to further optimize performance.
4. The cloud shadows will be turned off and the cloud sampling rate will be made lower if you have `StockVolumetricClouds` or `EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements` installed.
5. ASS avoids loading invisible celestial bodies by adopting the `OnDemand` loading method.

ASS balances performance and visual effects so that low-performance computers can run it smoothly.

## ***About Me***

   Hey everyone, first of all, thank you very much for reading this text, even though you may not have downloaded our Mod.  I am the earliest author of AfterSolarSystem Mod. My Chinese name is "Xuewen Chen". This is the name I gave to my friend NewoEther. I like it very much. I am from Foshan City, Guangdong Province, China. Of course, you can also assume that I am from Guangzhou City.  Because I really like taking the subway to Guangzhou.    But I was born in an unhappy family, a family full of feudalism, such as patriarchy, preference for sons over daughters, family disputes, selfishness and other issues. 
I was born on October 24, 2003. At birth, I was assigned the gender assigned male. But then when I entered the first grade of elementary school, I discovered that I did not belong to this assigned gender. But at that time, I did not actively come out to my family. But since then, I know that I am a MtF, It has been like this until now. Later, as I grew up, I found that my father and mother were selfish. My father was used to the patriarchal system in the family. He believed that women should serve men humbly. He always valued boys over girls and was afraid that I would have feminine tendencies. In the past, he tried not to allow me to have long hair and tried to make me have a buzz cut. He also deliberately uglified me. For example, during elementary and junior high school, he deliberately asked me to wear shabby clothes when I went out, as if this would allow others to see that I was a man no matter how far away I was. He seemed to think that this would give my family face (Chinese traditional culture values ​​boys over girls). But later, as I grew up, I refused. The most extreme incident in my memory happened in November 2023. At that time, my father asked me to cut my hair short because a stranger said that my hair was long, otherwise he would not be allowed to go home. He didn't care that my mental health had been much worse before that, and he didn't care whether I was happy or not...   When I was in elementary school, junior high school, and vocational school, I suffered humiliation almost every day. They insulted me because I was black, a primary school student, etc. This was because all this came from my parents’ upbringing logic. They thought that I was still very young at that time and didn’t need to I have my own phone number and personal social media account, and I don't have my own mobile communication device, but this makes me completely an alien. They always say that you should hang out with your classmates more, but if you don’t have a mobile phone or a social media account, how will you contact your classmates? Is it possible that in the 21st century, you still write letters to contact classmates in the same city? Whenever the school organizes outings, the classmates around me all bring their mobile phones to take photos and share them, but I am the only one who walks in the scenic spot with nothing. When I graduated, my personal contact information was completely blank. In such an environment, my inferiority complex became more and more serious, I became more and more uncomfortable, my studies began to deteriorate, and I began to become useless.

Especially after I went to vocational school, my mental health deteriorated drastically and I suffered from severe depression and anxiety. At that time, I did not do well in the high school entrance examination. They forced me to enroll in a cheap and extremely remote school, telling me to earn money for further education. That was the beginning of the worst four years of my life. I was enrolled in an automation major. This major was forcibly chosen by my father because he felt that I, as a boy, should study this because my father was also in this field (other than that, it saves money). ? ) But they didn’t understand it carefully before signing up for this major. For example, I suffer from color deficiency and cannot distinguish between yellow and green. This drawback will prevent me from pursuing this major. In addition, mathematics is my worst subject. My father blindly chose this major without understanding my various drawbacks, instead of choosing an art major based on my interests, such as painting, design, etc. (It may also be that they think painting costs money, which does not meet their premise of wanting me to grow up at the lowest cost). After arriving at the school, I was upset after only one week of classes because the school was very bad, with campus violence, students smoking, drinking, pornography, and gambling. The police came 2-3 times a month on average. In addition, the quality of the students was low. During my first week at this school, I encountered a lot of people verbally and physically attacking me, calling me a nigger. When I got home, I told them in a sad tone that I wanted to change my major or change schools (they seemed to reject my request on the grounds that they couldn’t spoil their children, and they even scolded me and made me cry). But at that time, changing majors was free, and they were unwilling to do so. Their strategy was to delay and try to dilute the problem with time, but unfortunately this could not be done. I suffered humiliation almost every day after that. My mental condition has deteriorated greatly over the past 4 years. But at the same time, I met a friend on the Internet, he is a cisgender male Muna, from our online communication, I learned that he lives in a happy family with the care and love of his family. Rather than being like my mother who only cared about my physical health, I cared about my mental health. In October 2022, I officially started making my AfterSolarSysyem Mod, until now.

My family’s upbringing gave me low self-esteem, pessimism, and fear of making friends. But in 2023, the appearance of a friend changed everything. She is "Yuhan". After meeting her, I learned to open my heart, made many friends, got more space to talk, and got to know more LGBT groups. We also met in Shenzhen together. But at the same time, my mental health was still deteriorating rapidly, and by July and August of 2023. By July and August 2023, I took the initiative to spend nearly 3,000 RMB to invite my mother to the psychiatric department to see a doctor with me. But unfortunately, within a few days, my mother's mind returned to its original state. She only cared about my body and not my mental health. But what I needed most was the care of my mental health. In early October 2023, I was approached by the police for purchasing chemical agents to attempt suicide. When they learned about this, they were not concerned about me at first, but whether there was a record of me or them, and whether it would affect our future lives, lol...

In December 2023, I admit that I was selfish and went to another city to live for half a month without contacting them, but I wanted to restore my mental health more. When I was with them, they only cared about benefits and money, and physical health... Although this made them very worried.   When they found out I was in Chengdu, I had guessed that the first question they would ask was, "Do I not have to go to work?" (In fact, I have more things to hide from them. During that period in 2023, the property management company I first worked for said that my hair was too long and I could not pass the probation period, so I was forced to leave. But later, I even saw employees who dyed their hair or permed their hair. After that, I worked in other companies for about half a month to a month, but later they all said that I was not suitable and were forced to leave.) Until now, I have been doing some simple part-time jobs. For me, being in a closed and noisy place or doing high-intensity physical work all day long is almost unbearable. During the Spring Festival in 2024, my mother told all my relatives that I was depressed, crazy and cutting my hands at home. (That’s the tone that deliberately mocks me)

What's more selfish about my parents is that in 2010, my parents kicked my grandparents out of the house and asked them to buy a new house. Later in 2015, after my grandfather passed away, my grandma lived alone in a house without anyone to accompany her. She was already 80 years old, and my father only came to see her 3-4 times a month. In addition to my father, I was the only one who came back to see her after my part-time job every day. After my grandfather passed away, my mother even hoped that my grandma would die with him... Now, my father and my mother have been sleeping separately, and my grandma lives alone in a house.
In fact, my father, my grandma, and even my grandfather are selfish people, and their brains have been invaded by patriarchal culture.…..

That's all you know about me. If you think I'm a loser and need to criticize me, I will listen patiently. I'm very lonely now, with no one to accompany me. If you are willing, you are welcome to chat with me. Welcome to become best friends or even lovers with me. If you are willing, you are welcome to provide me with some financial support. I will be very grateful to you.
