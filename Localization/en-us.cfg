        #ASS_Neso_name = Neso
		#ASS_Neso_desc = Neso is one of Neptune's surviving satellites, and it may be the most distant satellite from Neptune. Currently, Neso orbits Neptune alone in an orbit very far away from Neptune, so it takes a long time for it to orbit Neptune. If you are here and look up at the sky, Neptune seems to be just a slightly brighter star. Therefore this world may seem to us the loneliest existence in existence. \nIt is being forgotten.

        #ASS_Pluto_name = Pluto
		#ASS_Pluto_desc = This is a distant and cold world where our common canyons, mountains, and plains are all made of ice. Because of this, this can be a great place to watch the sun in its final glory. However, it is recommended to wear sunglasses. \n\n What else is there on the surface of this world now besides extreme cold? We don't know. Perhaps we can find something near the equator?

        #ASS_Eris_name = Eris
		#ASS_Eris_desc = Eris is an incredibly cold world, located beyond human reach. It is a pristine world that has not even been impacted by asteroids for billions of years. \nWe believe that as the temperature rises, the nitrogen ice that has long existed as solid ice crystals above the surface will sublime, and the atmospheric pressure in local areas under the thin atmosphere may rise to a level that allows the solid nitrogen ice crystals to melt and form liquids. Perhaps we can find those liquid nitrogen lakes on this icy dwarf planet.

Its dark appearance makes it greedily enjoy the release of the sun as it enters its final glorious moments. The energy that comes out has caused the temperature of the moon to rise and be higher than the dwarf star below. Despite this, it is still a desolate and deathly silent world.

        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowcrewReport = You are slowly feeling that the temperature around you is rising rapidly, and the strong sunlight shining through the portholes makes it almost impossible to open your eyes. \nSo you put on your special sunglasses and looked out the porthole. You finally saw the true face of the huge red luminous sphere that had been hidden by the high light - it was a huge plasma that was constantly rolling. \n You begin to worry about whether the thin walls of the spacecraft can protect your safety.
        #ASS_SunInSpace =              Viewed from this position, the sun is the brightest star in the sky. You can easily see it even if you are dozens of light-years away. Its light is bright enough to eclipse other stars. However, that is just the glory before death of a star, and all stars will experience it.
        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowevaReport =  I feel my body temperature is rising rapidly. Can a space suit really keep me safe?
        #ASS_SunSunInSpaceevaReport =  It may be safe to look at the dazzling star at this distance, so you lower the visor on the visor of your space suit and stare at the star. A question pops up in your mind: "Will the sun really have a helium flash?"
        #ASS_SunFlyingcrewReport =  We are almost reaching the chromosphere, and you see the huge plasma rolling below. At the same time, you carefully pilot the spacecraft to avoid the sun's coronal mass ejections.
        #ASS_SunFlyingevaReport = "I want to fly into the sky and stand shoulder to shoulder with the sun. The world is waiting for me to change. I am not afraid of others seeing my dreams. I can achieve them here."

        #ASS_EarthInSpaceLowevaReport = The blue sky and white clouds, the blue ocean are gone... \nInstead, there are boiling lava and red-hot ground.
        #ASS_EarthInSpaceevaReport = Is this really where we once were?
        #ASS_EarthFlyingcrewReport = The exciting journey begins~
        #ASS_EarthSrfLandedcrewReport = The ground is still very hot. The atmosphere is much thinner now than in the past. In the past, the air pressure here was hundreds of times greater than it is now. \nYou recalled that the temperature here could reach more than 2,000 degrees Celsius earlier due to the greenhouse effect.
        #ASS_EarthFlyingevaReport = I feel I'm in danger
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedcrewReport = We landed in hot lava. The temperature is so high here. Will our spacecraft be burned?

        #ASS_MoonInSpace =                  Looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar Moon outside the window, you are reminded of a section of a poem written by a Chinese poet billions of years ago: "When you are young, you don't know the moon, and you call it a white jade plate."
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowevaReport =      You stare carefully at the moon below the spacecraft, trying to find something. Suddenly you find a long trace on the moon. You initially thought it was caused by rock sliding, but after seeing the detector at the end of the scratch, You gave up on the idea.
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceevaReport =         A desolate, cratered world with a handful of lava lakes, maybe it's not very hot?

        #ASS_JupiterInSpacecrewReport =     You see the largest planet in the solar system, see its beautiful streaks and its huge, rapidly rotating storms, and feel Jupiter's immense gravity pulling on us. \nAt the same time, you start to observe Jupiter with a telescope, and you see 4 Galilean satellites and nearly a hundred small moons dancing slowly around Jupiter.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingcrewReport =      You feel that the huge gravity is pressing you down on the seat. At this moment, you are almost sinking into the seat. Every time you raise your hand, it is so laborious and difficult.
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowevaReport =   Jupiter is so huge that you'd think it was flat. \nYou turn your head and look at the crazy and raging storms on Jupiter. Each of them is so huge that they are even as big as the Earth.
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceevaReport =      As you stare at the gas planet and the stars in the sky in the background of Jupiter, you feel the insignificance of human beings and the vastness of the universe. You'll also notice that Jupiter also has a ring, but it doesn't seem as obvious.

        #ASS_JupiterFlyingLowevaReport =    The huge air pressure seems to be crushing me. I feel that the density and temperature of the gas around me are getting higher and higher. It seems very dark here, and the sunlight cannot penetrate the thick clouds. I can barely see my fingers. Only the occasional strong lightning could illuminate the dark surroundings. \nAt the same time, I felt strong winds blowing against me, as if they were going to blow the spacecraft apart. \nWill I die? \nNo, I want to go home.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingcrewReportPR =    You noticed that there are an unusually high number of storms near the poles of Jupiter.

        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowevaReportEB = Why are these cloud bands red?
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowevaReportTB = The atmosphere below you is violently moving, and you see lightning in the atmosphere.
        #ASS_JupiterInSpaceLowevaReportPR = It seems that at first I mistakenly thought that there were no obvious big storms on Jupiter, until I saw the poles of Jupiter.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingevaReportPR =         I'm falling into the stormy world below, hoping I won't be torn apart by the hurricane.
        #ASS_JupiterFlyingevaReportTB =         A few drops of water appeared on your helmet, but disappeared quickly.

        #ASS_MirandaevaSrfLanded =          The gravity here is so low that you can reach tens of meters high with just a slight jump. If this world had an atmosphere, skydiving would feel amazing here.

        #ASS_ArielInSpaceLowcreawReport =   Suddenly a bold idea came to mind: You might be able to land and return to this celestial body with your jetpack.
        #ASS_ArielInSpace =                 You notice that this gray moon looks anything but smooth from a distance. It is full of canyons and has a lot of craters.
        #ASS_ArielSrfLandedcrewReport =     The spacecraft landed on the slippery ground, slid for a distance and stopped safely.
        #ASS_ArielInSpaceLowevaReport =     Maybe you could land directly with a jetpack? But no one has ever succeeded.
        #ASS_ArielInSpaceevaReport =        Will it spew a mixture of ice and water from cracks like Enceladus?
        #ASS_ArielevaSrfLanded =            You are looking up at the stars, trying to find the location of your home planet.

        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceLowcreawReport = It looks very boring. You can hardly find any features in the gray landscape.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpace = Then you notice that it has two craters filled with white. They are like a pair of eyes, staring straight at you.
        #ASS_UmbrielSrfLandedcrewReport = It seems that the surface is covered with a thick layer of ash. When the spacecraft landed, the engine back-up blew away some of the ash. Now it is slowly falling. Some of the ash fell on the spacecraft, making the spacecraft look much dirtier.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceLowevaReport = You noticed that this "moon" looks grayer than the other four satellites.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceevaReport = Maybe this celestial body is covered with a lot of dust, which makes this "frozen moon" look dirty.
        #ASS_UmbrielevaSrfLanded = Your boots left a clear footprint on this celestial body.

        #ASS_Titania114514 =                Your eye is drawn to the strange white landforms, but you are not sure how they were formed
        #ASS_Titania114514 =                You notice that the north and south polar regions of this moon appear to be whiter and brighter than the regions near the equator.
        #ASS_Titania114514 =                Uranus overhead is like a huge moon, glowing blue under the sunlight.
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyingLowevaReport =    An icy red desert
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyLowevaReport =       You notice that the distant hillsides seem to be covered with some white substance, making them appear whiter than the base of the mountains.
        #ASS_TitaniaInSpaceLowcreawReport = It seems that the world below reflects a scary reddish-brown color under the sunlight.
        #ASS_TitaniaInSpace =               You noticed that there are several large white spots on this celestial body, but you are not sure whether they are caused by geological movement.
        #ASS_TItaniaSrfLandedcrewReport =   It’s not until the spacecraft lands that you discover that this world has an atmosphere so thin that you mistake it for the onboard computer’s misjudgment.
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyingcrewReport =      The world below is red in contrast to its temperature.

        #ASS_OberonInSpaceLowcreawReport =  You observe several large craters below, which may indicate that the satellite has suffered a huge impact.
        #ASS_OberonInSpace =                You notice that the northern region of this icy moon seems to be brighter than the rest of the planet, making it look like a large ice cap.
        #ASS_OberonSrfLandedcrewReport =    Outside the port window is a cold red desert with several strange large rocks in the desert.
        #ASS_OberonInSpaceLowevaReport =    The ice sheet below appears to be a strange red color, as if eroded by blood.
        #ASS_OberonInSpaceevaReport =       A boring and dead world
        #ASS_OberonevaSrfLanded =           You set foot on this icy desert, and with every step you take, you leave a distinct footprint on this land.

        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that there is a lot of space debris orbiting Neptune at very fast speeds.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceevaReport =      You are floating in empty space looking at the giant ice giant below, and you discover a huge cyclone in the clouds of Neptune.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingLowevaReport =    My vision is blocked by fog, the situation is very dangerous!
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReport =       The situation is dangerous!
        #ASS_NeptuneevaSrfLanded =          You are standing on Neptune's icy shell, feeling the strong winds blowing by several times the speed of sound. You look up and see lightning and thunder in the thick clouds above, and they seem to go on continuously. These lightning bolts illuminate the dark surroundings below.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfSplashedevaReport =  The liquid down there feels really weird to you because it looks like water but not water.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowcrawReport =  You look out your window and see the intense atmospheric activity of Neptune below.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpacecrewReport =     You don't know how long you have been sailing alone in this empty universe.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReport =      Let's hope the hurricane doesn't break up the ship.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfSplashedcrewReport = You look at the liquid outside the window and feel that it is very strange. It is obviously water, but it doesn't look like it, and the density is very high. Even a spaceship as heavy as yours can still float on it.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReport =   You've landed on Neptune's icy crust, but you still feel like your entire spacecraft is shaking.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReporImpontiStormEyet = The huge cyclone below seems to be sucking us into it.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReportImpontiStormEye = You feel the wind speed around you getting faster and faster.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingLowevaReportImpontiStormEye = You notice strong lightning near the storm.
        #ASS_NeptuneevaSrfLandedImpontiStormEye = You look at the huge storm above your head, it seems to swallow everything like a black hole
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReportImpontiStormEye = You are sailing in a big storm, and you feel the strong hurricane force causing your ship to start shaking violently.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReportImpontiStormEye = Through the porthole, you saw the huge storm above. It was rotating at high speed, accompanied by strong lightning.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReportImpontiStormEye = You are sailing in a big storm, and you feel the strong hurricane force causing your ship to start shaking violently.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReportImpontiStormEye = Through the porthole, you saw the huge storm above. It was rotating at high speed, accompanied by strong lightning.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceevaReportWC =        You notice a white cloud floating in Neptune's atmosphere below. What is the composition of this cloud?
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReportWC =         Their composition appears to be water vapor.    
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReportWC =        Look, the white clouds outside the window! Why does it appear on gas planets?
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReportPB =     Look, Clouds!

        #ASS_NereidInSpacecrewReport = You use a telescope to observe this huge rock, and you observe several particularly large craters.
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceLowcrawReport= The world below seems to be no different from other asteroids, with many rocks scattered on the surface. The only difference is that it seems to be brighter on the ground.
        #ASS_NereidSrfLandedcrewReport = It is not tidally locked, so if you look far away at the horizon, you can see the sun and Neptune rise and set.
        #ASS_NereidSrfLandedcrewReportCraters= You landed in one of the larger craters, perhaps this world has been hit by a violent impact. When you are in this crater, you find that this crater is so big and deep.
        #ASS_NereidSrfLandedcrewReportHighlands = Actually, to be precise, this place should not be called a "mountain".
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceevaReport= The surface of this small stone seems to be relatively smooth, and there are not many craters. There are only a few very large ones that look out of place.
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceevaReportLow = The ice below seems to be reflecting the faint sunlight. For such a small object, this reflectivity may be very bright.
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceevaReportLowCraters = You look at the huge craters and feel a sense of fear, as if the craters have penetrated deep into the crust and even the mantle.
        #ASS_NereidevaSrfLanded = The heat of the sun seems pale and weak. The weak light shines on the distant horizon and then reflects into your eyes, creating a strange feeling.
        #ASS_NereidevaSrfLandedCraters = There doesn't seem to be anything special in the crater, but there are too many debris and rocks here. If you are not careful, you may trip and your helmet will be pierced by the sharp rocks.

        #ASS_NesoInSpaceevaReport = When you first see it, you might think it's an asteroid. It's hard to believe it's a satellite of Neptune.
        #ASS_NesoInSpaceevaReportLow = You can hardly see many craters, only a few large ones, and a "mountain" that grows very high in low gravity.
        #ASS_NesoevaSrfLanded = Every step is so difficult in this low gravity environment.
        #ASS_NesoevaSrfLandedHighlands = You look up at the stars, trying to find the direction of Neptune. But after trying, you find that you can't see Neptune at all.
        #ASS_NesoevaSrfLandedCraters = Maybe this moon is just a lone traveler accompanying Neptune around the Sun.
        #ASS_NesoInSpaceevaReportLowHighlands = Aha? A gigantic mountain?
        #ASS_NesoInSpaceevaReportLowMidlands = You are trying to find something special.
        #ASS_NesoInSpacecrewReport = The average distance between us and Neptune is about one-third of the distance between Mercury and the Sun. You see this moon is so far away from Neptune.
        #ASS_NesoInSpaceLowcrawReport = Even though you have verified that it is not tidally locked to Neptune, you are still curious as to why it is spinning so slowly.
        #ASS_NesoSrfLandedcrewReport = If you want to keep the spacecraft firmly on the ground, then maybe the best thing to do is to throw a ground anchor to fix the spacecraft to the ground. That might be the best option.
        #ASS_NesoSrfLandedcrewReportHighlands = You are looking for Neptune with your telescope pointed at the blackness of space.
        #ASS_NesoSrfLandedcrewReportLowlands = The hills in the distance look very smooth, without any blemishes. They reflect starlight just like mirrors.
        #ASS_NesoSrfLandedcrewReport = You can't wait to get out of the ship and have a high jump contest here.

        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowcrawReport =    You see that giant heart in Pluto's southern hemisphere, a way to show your love to Charon.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpacecrewReport =       This inseparable pair dances in the distant Kuiper Belt, which orbits the sun. Also has 4 smaller followers.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReport =        You look at the frozen world below and notice a few strange tracks, like the tracks of a car driving through the sand.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReport =     Through the glass, you see the giant companion star Charon hanging in the sky. At this time you can't wait to get out because you don't know how long you have been on the spacecraft.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReport =     Pluto looks cute
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceevaReport =        From this angle, the sun's light has become much softer, and there is no longer that dazzling feeling.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingLowevaReport =      You admire the beauty of the universe
        #ASS_PlutoFlyLowevaReport =         At this moment, you appreciate the vastness of the universe and the greatness of life.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLanded =            You look up at the starry sky and find that the starry sky is very bright. You turn your head to look at the sun and find that there is a group of nebulae emitting dark red light around the sun, and they are slowly spreading outward.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLandedTombaughRegio = You noticed that the terrain in this area is relatively flat.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReportTombaughRegio = A huge heart.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingLowevaReportTombaughRegio = Suddenly, you notice that there seems to be a red statue with a human face on the ground.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingevaReportTombaughRegio =     You stare at the heart-shaped plain below, trying to discover something.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReportTombaughRegio =    Through the hanging window, you looked at the endless white tundra outside the window.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReportTombaughRegio = You noticed that the tundra outside the window is constantly emitting gas, which may be nitrogen.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyLowevaReportSolitudeisland =    You seem to have found a strange structure in the southern part of the hills. It looks like a red mound.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLandedSolitudeisland =       You noticed that there are many mountains here, but they are lower in altitude and darker in color.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReportSolitudeisland = From here, you see a lot of mountains below.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReportSolitudeisland =      The hills below look very dark and a bit reddish. Could it be methane?
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReportSolitudeisland = Through the porthole, you see endless gray hills outside the window, but they don't seem to be high.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingcrewReportBaiJiLake = Suddenly, you are horrified to find a car next to the crater below!
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowcrawReportBaiJiLake = The nitrogen ice in the crater below appears crystal clear in the reflection of the sun.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReportBaiJiLake = The world outside the window is so charming. The ice on the ground reflects the light blue light under the light of the sun, and shines into the spacecraft through the glass.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReportBaiJiisland = You use a telescope and carefully observe the landscape below, and you realize that you have indeed seen a car on the surface of Pluto.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingLowevaReportBaiJiisland = You look around, trying to find something.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLandedBaiJiisland = You notice that there seems to be a small hole on the ground not far away that is slowly spewing gas.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfSplashed = Your sampling confirms that the liquid is liquid methane, but it seems to be very unstable.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfSplashedevaReport = The gravity here is not very strong, so you can float in the methane.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfSplashedcrewReport = Perhaps the unique environment of the crater here makes the atmospheric pressure and temperature in this area higher than the surrounding area, allowing the methane to exist? But it does not seem to be stable, and there is a lot of smoke coming out of the liquid. They are boiling.

        #ASS_CharonInSpaceLowevaReport =    Pluto looks lovely
        #ASS_CharonInSpaceevaReport =       You watch in silence as the binary star system orbits each other under the influence of gravity. You feel like you are outside the world at this moment.
        #ASS_CharonevaSrfLanded =           When you stand on this celestial body and look at the distant galaxies, you have no concept of time. In your eyes, time is no longer one-way. So now you see the scene in the future when you encounter an accident and die on your home star when you return home and re-enter the atmosphere.
        #ASS_CharonInSpaceLowcrawReport =   It looks a little whiter than Pluto, perhaps because there is more snow on the surface.
        #ASS_CharonInSpacecrewReport =      Charon seems to be saying to Pluto, "Pluto loves you. You can tell, right?"
        #ASS_CharonSrfLandedcrewReport =    You grab the sled, open the hatch, and try to get out and ski.

        #ASS_ErisFlyingcrewReport =         The incredible cold of the world below almost weakens the metal from which the ship is constructed.
        #ASS_ErisSrfSplashedcrewReport =    The spacecraft has landed on a sea of liquid nitrogen. You may need to get out of here quickly. In such a cold environment, even strong metals become very fragile.
        #ASS_ErisSrfLandedcrewReport =      The spacecraft landed on this cold land. After landing, your spacecraft turned on the heating system to prevent the fuel it carried from condensing. At the same time, you find that there is a lot of fog on the glass of the porthole, and it seems that they cannot be wiped away.
        #ASS_ErisInSpaceLowevaReport =      You stare in horror at a world below that is so frigid that nitrogen can condense solid here.
        #ASS_ErisInSpaceevaReport =         You look at this dwarf planet in a discrete disk, and then look back at the sun. You find that the brightness of the sun at this time is almost the same as the brightness of the full moon on Earth in the past.
        #ASS_ErisFlyingLowevaReport =       A lot of fog begins to appear on the outside of your helmet, and then it solidifies into ice, which greatly reduces your vision.
        #ASS_ErisFlyLowevaReport =          Due to the huge temperature difference, your spacesuit slowly begins to freeze.
        #ASS_ErisevaSrfLanded =             You looked at the extremely cold world in front of you and took the first step. You looked back at your spaceship and found that the engine on your spacecraft was emitting gas. Not long after, it quickly condensed into a solid and fell to the ground.
        #ASS_ErisSrfSplashedevaReport =     You put on a special space suit and try to swim, but due to the very low density, you keep sinking.

        #ASS_DysomiaLandedNorthernMidlands = Through the weak sunlight, you see the ground is slowly emitting gas, I hope it is not your illusion
        #ASS_DysnomiaInSpaceLowcrawReport = Your eyes adjust to the dim light, and the dark world below gradually becomes clear.
        #ASS_DysnomiaInSpacecrewReport = A dark "moon"
        #ASS_DysnomiaevaSrfLanded = Even with the heating device turned up to the maximum, you seem to feel a chill.
        #ASS_DysnomiaInSpaceLowevaReport = Compared to Eris, its reflectivity is almost as dark as coal.

        #ASS_MarssurfaceTaerxisiSwamp_ =        The water content in the soil is very high, and you can clearly see water seeping out of the fertile soil.
        #ASS_MarssurfaceTaerxisiSwamp_ =        The yellow sand below becomes very hot under the baking of the sun. Even with a layer of gloves, you can still mx. Even with a layer of gloves between you, you can clearly feel it
        #ASS_MarssurfaceCanyonsailor =          The soil here is very fertile, containing not only water but also a lot of organic matter.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashedCanyonsailor =      The water here seems to be no different from other places, except that the temperature is cooler.
        #ASS_MarsSrfSplashed =                  The liquid water here seems to be so warm that holding a container of seawater feels like holding a glass of water.
