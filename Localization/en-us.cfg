You finally saw the true face of the huge red luminous sphere that had been hidden by the high light - it was a huge plasma that was constantly rolling. \n You begin to worry about whether the thin walls of the spacecraft can protect your safety.
        #ASS_SunInSpace =              Viewed from this position, the sun is the brightest star in the sky. You can easily see it even if you are dozens of light-years away. Its light is bright enough to eclipse other stars. However, that is just the glory before death of a star, and all stars will experience it.
        #ASS_SunInSpaceLowevaReport =  I feel my body temperature is rising rapidly. Can a space suit really keep me safe?
        #ASS_SunSunInSpaceevaReport =  It may be safe to look at the dazzling star at this distance, so you lower the visor on the visor of your space suit and stare at the star. A question pops up in your mind: "Will the sun really have a helium flash?"
        #ASS_SunFlyingcrewReport =  We are almost reaching the chromosphere, and you see the huge plasma rolling below. At the same time, you carefully pilot the spacecraft to avoid the sun's coronal mass ejections.

        #ASS_EarthFlyingcrewReport = The exciting journey begins~
        #ASS_EarthSrfLandedcrewReport = The ground is still very hot. The atmosphere is much thinner now than in the past. In the past, the air pressure here was hundreds of times greater than it is now. \nYou recalled that the temperature here could reach more than 2,000 degrees Celsius earlier due to the greenhouse effect.
        #ASS_EarthFlyingevaReport = I feel I'm in danger
        #ASS_EarthSrfSplashedcrewReport = We landed in hot lava. The temperature is so high here. Will our spacecraft be burned?

        #ASS_MoonInSpace =                  Looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar Moon outside the window, you are reminded of a section of a poem written by a Chinese poet billions of years ago: "When you are young, you don't know the moon, and you call it a white jade plate."
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowevaReport =      You stare carefully at the moon below the spacecraft, trying to find something. Suddenly you find a long trace on the moon. You initially thought it was caused by rock sliding, but after seeing the detector at the end of the scratch, You gave up on the idea.
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceevaReport =         A desolate, cratered world with a handful of lava lakes, maybe it's not very hot?

        #ASS_MoonSrfLandedevaReport =       You set foot on this familiar and unfamiliar land, and the scene of the first human landing on the moon emerges in your mind. You turn your head and look at the footprints behind you, as if you have returned to the moment of the first moon landing in human history. All of this is so familiar.
        #ASS_MoonInSpaceLowevaReportMoonSea = The lunar sea below still looks familiar.
        #ASS_MoonSrfLandedevaReportMoonSea = So the past is the past.

        #ASS_TitanSurfSampleNorthernhills = There seems to be a lot of moss in the wet soil, and it feels a bit disgusting to hold in your hand.
        #ASS_TitanSurfSampleSoutherndelta = You try to find evidence of microorganisms in the soil.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceLowevaReport = You are floating in orbit nearly 600 kilometers above Titan. At this altitude, you can see wide rivers, huge lakes, white-covered land, and slowly drifting white clouds on this satellite. At this moment, the only thing separating you from it is the atmosphere nearly 600 kilometers high. This is the last distance in nearly a billion kilometers.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceevaReport = You are floating in the empty space, and you feel endless loneliness and emptiness. At this time, "Light Years Away" is playing in your headphones. At this moment, you feel that your current situation is integrated into the song, and you can't help but hum along with the song.
        #ASS_TitanFlyingevaReport = The situation is somewhat dangerous
        #ASS_TitanFlyingLowevaReport = The situation is very dangerous
        #ASS_TitanSrfSplashedevaReport = You take off your helmet and soak in the waters of this alien world. You dive into the water and find that the water is not as turbid as you imagined. You see the water plants under the water swaying constantly with the flow of water.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedevaReport = You look up at the huge mushroom and want to run over to take a bite to see if it can be eaten.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedevaReportCoolWater = The soil here contains a lot of water, so much so that when you step on it, you can see water being squeezed out, and your boots become dirty.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceLowevaReportCoolWater = Is that water?
        #ASS_TitanFlyingLowevaReportCoolWater = Perhaps the soft mud can alleviate a large part of the impact.
        #ASS_TitanInSpaceLowcrawReport = In your spacecraft orbiting Titan, you see how beautiful this distant planet is. You see the world slowly rolling beneath your feet. From this altitude you cannot see any man-made structures, they are too small. Although you know that this fascinating celestial body has oxygen in its atmosphere, you know that you cannot breathe it directly.
        #ASS_TitanInSpacecrewReport = From this altitude you can see the whole picture of Titan. This world has a large area of ​​land with several rivers running through it.
        #ASS_TitanFlyingcrewReport = We are flying in Titan's atmosphere. The atmosphere here seems to be 1 times thicker than the home planet. You may need more power to fly fast. At this altitude it seems that you can reach out and touch the sky.
        #ASS_TitanSrfSplashedcrewReport = You landed in the waters of Titan. In this gravity environment, you observe that the height of the waves is much higher than our spacecraft. They are slowly coming towards us. But you don't need to worry at all, because we have enough time to escape before this huge wave sweeps over. \nAt the same time, you find that the rivers and lakes here are very shallow.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedcrewReport = You look at the cold desert outside the window. It seems a bit desolate, with only a few giant mushrooms, but these mushrooms seem to be surprisingly huge, and their height seems to be nearly 100 meters high.
        #ASS_TitanSrfLandedcrewReportCoolWater = You noticed that the attitude of the spacecraft seems a bit unbalanced. Is it stuck in the mud?

        #ASS_IapetusInSpaceLowcreawReport = You noticed a strange bulge in the equatorial region of Iapetus and a huge crater in the northern hemisphere. \nIts existence makes you think, is this really not a giant spaceship?
        #ASS_IapetusInSpace =               The world seems to be made of white and brown. It seems like the two hemispheres are different colors.
        #ASS_IapetusSrfLandedcrewReport =   Through the porthole, you saw a silent alien world, but it seemed a little weird?
        #ASS_IapetusInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that there appears to be a moon orbiting Iapetus
        #ASS_IapetusInSpaceevaReport =      A giant alien spaceship?

        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowcrawReport = You notice a huge white cloud at the north pole of Uranus, which looks like a huge ice cap. \nAt the same time, you find that the world seems to be very dead, with almost no cyclones in the clouds below.
        #ASS_UranusInSpacecrewReport = The long space voyage has made you full of fatigue and stress. The moment you see Uranus, all the tension and fatigue disappear instantly. You no longer remember how long it has been since you left home and sailed in this dark universe.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingcrewReport = Gravity presses you firmly on the seat, but after a while, you adapt to the gravity here and find that the gravity here is not high.
        #ASS_UranusSrfSplashedcrewReport = You look at the liquid outside the window and feel that it is very strange. It is obviously water, but it doesn't look like it, and the density is very high. Even a spaceship as heavy as you can still float on it.
        #ASS_UranusSrfLandedcrewReport = We seem to have reached a balance with gravity as we continue to fall, and we can say that we have "dive" into the interior of this ice giant. The atmospheric pressure outside the cabin at this moment was astonishingly high, almost crushing the spacecraft.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowevaReport = Looking at Uranus below, you seem very excited, as if the fatigue brought by ten years of space travel has all disappeared at this moment.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceevaReport = A beautiful gaseous planet that reflects a beautiful blue-white color when illuminated by the sun. \nYou also noticed that Uranus also has a ring, but it seems a little dim.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingLowevaReport = The situation is dangerous.
        #ASS_UranusFlyLowevaReport = I think it’s time for me to get back in the spaceship, otherwise I’ll never come home again
        #ASS_UranusevaSrfLanded = I don’t know why, but you feel uncomfortable when you are here, as if you have no body, and you feel light all over, even if you are wearing a bulky space suit.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingcrewReportEye = It seems that a huge black hole has appeared in this blue cloud.
        #ASS_UranusFlyingcrewReportSPB = The surrounding clouds are very bright.
        #ASS_UranusInSpaceLowevaReportSPB = It seems like a huge ice cap.

        #ASS_MirandaInSpace =               Look, Miranda!
        #ASS_MirdandaSrfLandedcrewReport =  You tried to experience skydiving with a parachute in Verona Rupes. \nBut the moment you open the hatch, you realize that this frozen world has no atmosphere.
        #ASS_MirandaInSpaceLowevaReport =   In such a low gravity environment, maybe it's safe
        #ASS_MirandaInSpaceevaReport =      You look at Verona Rupes and realize it is so high that you visually estimate it to be at least 20 kilometers high.
        #ASS_MirandaevaSrfLanded =          The gravity here is so low that you can reach tens of meters high with just a slight jump. If this world had an atmosphere, skydiving would feel amazing here.

        #ASS_ArielInSpaceLowcreawReport =   Suddenly a bold idea came to mind: You might be able to land and return to this celestial body with your jetpack.
        #ASS_ArielInSpace =                 You notice that this gray moon looks anything but smooth from a distance. It is full of canyons and has a lot of craters.
        #ASS_ArielSrfLandedcrewReport =     The spacecraft landed on the slippery ground, slid for a distance and stopped safely.
        #ASS_ArielInSpaceLowevaReport =     Maybe you could land directly with a jetpack? But no one has ever succeeded.
        #ASS_ArielInSpaceevaReport =        Will it spew a mixture of ice and water from cracks like Enceladus?
        #ASS_ArielevaSrfLanded =            You are looking up at the stars, trying to find the location of your home planet.

        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceLowcreawReport = It looks very boring. You can hardly find any features in the gray landscape.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpace = Then you notice that it has two craters filled with white. They are like a pair of eyes, staring straight at you.
        #ASS_UmbrielSrfLandedcrewReport = It seems that the surface is covered with a thick layer of ash. When the spacecraft landed, the engine back-up blew away some of the ash. Now it is slowly falling. Some of the ash fell on the spacecraft, making the spacecraft look much dirtier.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceLowevaReport = You noticed that this "moon" looks grayer than the other four satellites.
        #ASS_UmbrielInSpaceevaReport = Maybe this celestial body is covered with a lot of dust, which makes this "frozen moon" look dirty.
        #ASS_UmbrielevaSrfLanded = Your boots left a clear footprint on this celestial body.

        #ASS_Titania114514 =                Your eye is drawn to the strange white landforms, but you are not sure how they were formed

        #ASS_TitaniaInSpace =               You noticed that there are several large white spots on this celestial body, but you are not sure whether they are caused by geological movement.
        #ASS_TItaniaSrfLandedcrewReport =   It’s not until the spacecraft lands that you discover that this world has an atmosphere so thin that you mistake it for the onboard computer’s misjudgment.
        #ASS_TitaniaFlyingcrewReport =      The world below is red in contrast to its temperature.

        #ASS_OberonInSpaceLowcreawReport =  You observe several large craters below, which may indicate that the satellite has suffered a huge impact.
        #ASS_OberonInSpace =                You notice that the northern region of this icy moon seems to be brighter than the rest of the planet, making it look like a large ice cap.
        #ASS_OberonSrfLandedcrewReport =    Outside the port window is a cold red desert with several strange large rocks in the desert.
        #ASS_OberonInSpaceLowevaReport =    The ice sheet below appears to be a strange red color, as if eroded by blood.
        #ASS_OberonInSpaceevaReport =       A boring and dead world
        #ASS_OberonevaSrfLanded =           You set foot on this icy desert, and with every step you take, you leave a distinct footprint on this land.

        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReport =   You notice that there is a lot of space debris orbiting Neptune at very fast speeds.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceevaReport =      You are floating in empty space looking at the giant ice giant below, and you discover a huge cyclone in the clouds of Neptune.

        #ASS_NeptuneevaSrfLanded =          You are standing on Neptune's icy shell, feeling the strong winds blowing by several times the speed of sound. You look up and see lightning and thunder in the thick clouds above, and they seem to go on continuously. These lightning bolts illuminate the dark surroundings below.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfSplashedevaReport =  The liquid down there feels really weird to you because it looks like water but not water.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowcrawReport =  You look out your window and see the intense atmospheric activity of Neptune below.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpacecrewReport =     You don't know how long you have been sailing alone in this empty universe.
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReport =      Let's hope the hurricane doesn't break up the ship.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfSplashedcrewReport = You look at the liquid outside the window and feel that it is very strange. It is obviously water, but it doesn't look like it, and the density is very high. Even a spaceship as heavy as yours can still float on it.
        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReport =   You've landed on Neptune's icy crust, but you still feel like your entire spacecraft is shaking.

        #ASS_NeptuneSrfLandedcrewReportImpontiStormEye = Through the porthole, you saw the huge storm above. It was rotating at high speed, accompanied by strong lightning.
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceevaReportWC =        You notice a white cloud floating in Neptune's atmosphere below. What is the composition of this cloud?
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyLowevaReportWC =         Their composition appears to be water vapor.    
        #ASS_NeptuneFlyingcrewReportWC =        Look, the white clouds outside the window! Why does it appear on gas planets?
        #ASS_NeptuneInSpaceLowevaReportPB =     Look, Clouds!

        #ASS_NereidInSpacecrewReport = You use a telescope to observe this huge rock, and you observe several particularly large craters.
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceLowcrawReport= The world below seems to be no different from other asteroids, with many rocks scattered on the surface. The only difference is that it seems to be brighter on the ground.
        #ASS_NereidSrfLandedcrewReport = It is not tidally locked, so if you look far away at the horizon, you can see the sun and Neptune rise and set.
        #ASS_NereidSrfLandedcrewReportCraters= You landed in one of the larger craters, perhaps this world has been hit by a violent impact. When you are in this crater, you find that this crater is so big and deep.
        #ASS_NereidSrfLandedcrewReportHighlands = Actually, to be precise, this place should not be called a "mountain".
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceevaReport= The surface of this small stone seems to be relatively smooth, and there are not many craters. There are only a few very large ones that look out of place.
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceevaReportLow = The ice below seems to be reflecting the faint sunlight. For such a small object, this reflectivity may be very bright.
        #ASS_NereidInSpaceevaReportLowCraters = You look at the huge craters and feel a sense of fear, as if the craters have penetrated deep into the crust and even the mantle.
        #ASS_NereidevaSrfLanded = The heat of the sun seems pale and weak. The weak light shines on the distant horizon and then reflects into your eyes, creating a strange feeling.
        #ASS_NereidevaSrfLandedCraters = There doesn't seem to be anything special in the crater, but there are too many debris and rocks here. If you are not careful, you may trip and your helmet will be pierced by the sharp rocks.

        #ASS_NesoInSpaceevaReport = When you first see it, you might think it's an asteroid. It's hard to believe it's a satellite of Neptune.

        #ASS_NesoInSpacecrewReport = The average distance between us and Neptune is about one-third of the distance between Mercury and the Sun. You see this moon is so far away from Neptune.
        #ASS_NesoInSpaceLowcrawReport = Even though you have verified that it is not tidally locked to Neptune, you are still curious as to why it is spinning so slowly.
        #ASS_NesoSrfLandedcrewReport = If you want to keep the spacecraft firmly on the ground, then maybe the best thing to do is to throw a ground anchor to fix the spacecraft to the ground. That might be the best option.

        #ASS_PlutoSrfLandedcrewReportBaiJiLake = The world outside the window is so charming. The ice on the ground reflects the light blue light under the light of the sun, and shines into the spacecraft through the glass.
        #ASS_PlutoInSpaceLowevaReportBaiJiisland = You use a telescope and carefully observe the landscape below, and you realize that you have indeed seen a car on the surface of Pluto.
        #ASS_PlutoFlyingLowevaReportBaiJiisland = You look around, trying to find something.
        #ASS_PlutoevaSrfLandedBaiJiisland = You notice that there seems to be a small hole on the ground not far away that is slowly spewing gas.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfSplashed = Your sampling confirms that the liquid is liquid methane, but it seems to be very unstable.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfSplashedevaReport = The gravity here is not very strong, so you can float in the methane.
        #ASS_PlutoSrfSplashedcrewReport = Perhaps the unique environment of the crater here makes the atmospheric pressure and temperature in this area higher than the surrounding area, allowing the methane to exist? But it does not seem to be stable, and there is a lot of smoke coming out of the liquid. They are boiling.

        #ASS_CharonInSpaceLowevaReport =    Pluto looks lovely
        #ASS_CharonInSpaceevaReport =       You watch in silence as the binary star system orbits each other under the influence of gravity. You feel like you are outside the world at this moment.
        #ASS_CharonevaSrfLanded =           When you stand on this celestial body and look at the distant galaxies, you have no concept of time. In your eyes, time is no longer one-way. So now you see the scene in the future when you encounter an accident and die on your home star when you return home and re-enter the atmosphere.
        #ASS_CharonInSpaceLowcrawReport =   It looks a little whiter than Pluto, perhaps because there is more snow on the surface.

        #ASS_ErisFlyingcrewReport =         The incredible cold of the world below almost weakens the metal from which the ship is constructed.
        #ASS_ErisSrfSplashedcrewReport =    The spacecraft has landed on a sea of liquid nitrogen. You may need to get out of here quickly. In such a cold environment, even strong metals become very fragile.
        #ASS_ErisSrfLandedcrewReport =      The spacecraft landed on this cold land. After landing, your spacecraft turned on the heating system to prevent the fuel it carried from condensing. At the same time, you find that there is a lot of fog on the glass of the porthole, and it seems that they cannot be wiped away.
        #ASS_ErisInSpaceLowevaReport =      You stare in horror at a world below that is so frigid that nitrogen can condense solid here.
        #ASS_ErisInSpaceevaReport =         You look at this dwarf planet in a discrete disk, and then look back at the sun. You find that the brightness of the sun at this time is almost the same as the brightness of the full moon on Earth in the past.
        #ASS_ErisFlyingLowevaReport =       A lot of fog begins to appear on the outside of your helmet, and then it solidifies into ice, which greatly reduces your vision.
        #ASS_ErisFlyLowevaReport =          Due to the huge temperature difference, your spacesuit slowly begins to freeze.
        #ASS_ErisevaSrfLanded =             You looked at the extremely cold world in front of you and took the first step. You looked back at your spaceship and found that the engine on your spacecraft was emitting gas. Not long after, it quickly condensed into a solid and fell to the ground.
        #ASS_ErisSrfSplashedevaReport =     You put on a special space suit and try to swim, but due to the very low density, you keep sinking.

        #ASS_DysomiaLandedNorthernMidlands = Through the weak sunlight, you see the ground is slowly emitting gas, I hope it is not your illusion
        #ASS_DysnomiaInSpaceLowcrawReport = Your eyes adjust to the dim light, and the dark world below gradually becomes clear.
        #ASS_DysnomiaInSpacecrewReport = A dark "moon"
        #ASS_DysnomiaevaSrfLanded = Even with the heating device turned up to the maximum, you seem to feel a chill.

You begin to use your telescope to observe the planet's satellites.
        #ASS_P9InSpacecrewReport = You notice a dim, unknown object outside the window. You don't know how long you've been away from home. You begin to miss the warm breeze, the sea, and the smell of your hometown, but you don’t know how long it will take before you can go back.
        #ASS_P9FlyingcrewReport = You can't help but feel a little scared when you hear strange noises outside the spaceship. Will the metal of the spaceship suffer from metal fatigue in such low temperatures?
        #ASS_P9FlyingcrewReportBC = You control your spaceship as it approaches these white clouds. At first glance, you'll notice they appear rather long and thin, standing out against the dark blue background, almost as if they were glowing.

        #ASS_P9InSpaceLowevaReportBC = Those white clouds may be made of ice, just like the clouds back home, but the difference is that the "ice" here refers to frozen methane and ammonia.
        #ASS_P9InSpaceLowevaReportPolar = When you fly over the polar regions of this planet, you notice that it seems to have no auroras. This is understandable, as it is extremely far from the Sun, having left the top of the heliosphere, and the solar wind is no longer able to reach it.

        #ASS_MunaFlyingevaReportJiOcean =      You are soaring above the white sea, you may want to be careful because the weather near the ocean is unpredictable.
        #ASS_MunaInSpaceLowevaReportJiOcean =   Is there life in the ocean below?

        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceLowcrawReport = You notice that the ship's trajectory seems unstable. Over time, if you don't correct the trajectory, the ship may crash into the world below or be pulled away by the Muna's gravity.

        #ASS_MinmausSrfLandedevaReport = You look up, trying to spot the Muna in the sky, and its massive halo. You can feel the insignificance and greatness of human beings in the universe from the shadow cast by this satellite on the star rings and the planet's surface.
        #ASS_MinmausSrfLandedcrewReportLowlands = Looking out the porthole, you see the miniature world outside. The surface is dotted with rubble, and in the distance, a chasm formed by unknown means.
        #ASS_MinmausInSpaceLowevaReportLowlands = In a low-gravity world, the size of mountains is generally not restricted by gravity, so you can clearly see small low-lying areas between the mountains.

        #ASS_MollInSpaceLowevaReport = You noticed that the gray land below is covered with dense craters. Their presence will greatly affect the landing of large vehicles in the future. \n Perhaps these craters can provide some insight into how old this world really is.
        #ASS_MollInSpaceevaReport = "There should be no hatred, why does the moon always appear full when parting? People experience joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, the moon waxes and wanes; it's impossible to have everything perfect. May we live long and share the beauty of the moon together, even though we are thousands of miles apart."
        #ASS_MollSrfLandedevaReport = The ground looks a bit slippery?
        #ASS_MuollInSpaceLowcrawReport = The most captivating thing about the monotonous world below is the vast canyon below.
        #ASS_MollInSpacecrewReport = It appears to be composed almost entirely of gray; you can hardly discern any other color.

        #ASS_InfraredTelescope00 =      You are observing the depths of the solar system with an infrared telescope, trying to discover mysterious objects hidden in the Oort cloud, or discover asteroids that pose a threat to us. \nBut in the process you discovered many red dwarfs that are invisible to the naked eye, as well as brown dwarfs.
        #ASS_InfraredTelescope01 =      You are using an infrared telescope to observe the universe. Without the Oort cloud and interstellar dust, the starry sky becomes brighter. Even though you're using an infrared telescope, it still reduces interference better. \nWhy hasn't this celestial body been noticed in the solar system before? Maybe it's because the star is far away from the ecliptic plane.
        #ASS_SunHighasteroidSample =    You collected a rock sample from an asteroid and aligned it for research. You found that the asteroid was a C-type asteroid. Although it was mainly composed of rocks, its density was very low.
        #ASS_InfraredTelescope02 =      You notice a very close brown dwarf that has a very slow proper motion. Maybe it's somewhere near our solar system.
        #ASS_TycheHighasteroidSample = This is a typical Oort cloud comet that you find is made almost entirely of ice. \n It may never come back after this flyby of Tyche.
